Important Note::

We recommend that you upgrade to 5.6.1 to avoid the issue. You can read the details of the problem and about mitigation if you are already experiencing the issue in this https://discuss.elastic.co/t/upgrade-issue-with-elastic-stack-5-6-0-workaround-option-until-fix-is-available/100595[forum post].
