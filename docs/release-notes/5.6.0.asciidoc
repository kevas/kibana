=== Enhancements
Management::
* Uses SavedObjectsClient for UI Settings {pull}12747[#12747]
* [Management] Provide a way to fetch index pattern titles {pull}13030[#13030]
  - This PR adds another method to the indexPatterns service to fetch index patterns titles. Since the code was nearly identical to how index pattern ids are fetched, I decided to slightly refactor the function to accept a parameter for which property to fetch from the index pattern. I've updated all usages to the new approach.
Operations::
* Saved objects compatibility layer {pull}12648[#12648]

Visualization::
* Adding ability to configure grid for TSVB {pull}12385[#12385]
* Adding option for controlling if last bucket is dropped for TSVB {pull}12379[#12379]
  - This PR creates an option in "Panel Options" and the metric index pattern override to allow the user to control if the last bucket should be dropped. By default TSVB will drop the last bucket since most of the time it's incomplete. This also changes the method for dropping the last bucket to a more reliable method.
* Fixes #12602 - Change TSVB Fields API to use fieldCaps API {pull}12611[#12611]

* [Fix for #12933] [chrome/nav/lastUrl] do not track redirect routes {pull}13432[#13432]
  - When you navigate to a URL that Kibana doesn't recognize it tries to be helpful and send you to discover. At the same time it tries to remember the URL you were last using in each app and bring back where you left off when you come back. Unfortunately, these two features recently collided. If youÂ somehow ended up at an unknown URL that looked like the URL for an app other than discover Kibana would get confused and remember the bad URL and immediately redirect you to discover. If you didn't give up right away you would probably try to go back to the app, but since it Kibana is trying to be helpful it would send you right back to the bad URL and then back to discover... Stupid right?! Well, it won't happen anymore!
